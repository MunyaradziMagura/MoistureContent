# Take-Home Coding Challenge: Moisture Content Worksheet

## Background 
Moisture content of soil and rock is an extremely useful measure of soil properties and is, as a result, a
very commonly carried out test.

In order to complete this chellange a code implmentation of the following questions must be implmented.
1. Define a Moisture Content object model that includes the fields in the Measurements, Dry Mass and Results sections.

2. Write code that calculates Material Wet Mass, Material Dry Mass and Water Content.
3. Write appropriate unit tests for the calculations in question 2.

## How to demo

- `npm i` to install node packages    
- `npm test` to run tests with [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
